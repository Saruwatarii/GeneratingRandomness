# GeneratingRandomness
## A small program for checking the assumption of people generating random things, whereas the program will predict "random" user actions.
1. Teach the program to remember user input and filter out symbols that are not 0s or 1s.
2. Next. form a user profile which are based on the data collected in step 1(minimum data is 100)
3. After the input processing and analyzing the user input, the data will go through a "predictor", where it will try to guess the users next input based on their previous inout.
4. From the predition, the program will also validate the result of its performance.
5. After getting the result, it will start a game, where the purpose is to beat the system in pressing random keys, in other words, try to be as unpredictable as possible!

Below is a snippet of the program:
